# Cloud Harvest
Welcome! Cloud Harvest is a project which collects information from remote APIs and provides an interface to view and interact with that data in the form of reports. Although the project was originally intended to collect AWS API information for infrastructure engineers, in theory Harvest's model could fit any use case where data needs to be retrieved regularly from an API and made accessible for review.

Developed in Python, we use a modular, configuration-driven approach so that users can develop their own data collection pipelines and reports. 

# Project Status
Cloud Harvest is in active development and is not yet in a usable state. Work continues steadily with plans to release the initial Alpha in late 2024.
